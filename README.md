# Rover-Project
A team project which I completed for the MECH-2 course at UBC



![CVT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46405515/94864661-310efe80-03f1-11eb-8e04-d4f15da9d595.JPG)- A rear view of the rover displays the CVT pullies and dog clutch mechanism. The idea behind this is that the ratio between the pullies can be varied with a servo. This allows for speed control of the rover without wasting power through friction during breaking or some other method. The dog clutch is necessary to house the return spring that applies force on the CVT pullies allowing for a seating force on the belt. The belt was too flimsy and gave us issues during operation. Ideally a sturdier belt would be used

It was actuated by a servo motor and has 3D printed parts to allow the front axels to interface with the moving wood components which we had laser cut. The system ended up working very well and being a strong point of the rover.


![SIDE1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46405515/94864666-32402b80-03f1-11eb-827d-89a8f252198b.JPG)- This side view shows the rover in action taking a corner. Also visible from this side are the motor housings which kept the dual motors secured during operation. 


![ISIDE2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46405515/94864668-32d8c200-03f1-11eb-89e6-44c2e545dc57.JPG)- This side view shows the rover at a stand still. Here the profile of the rover is clearly visible along with some other components of the drive train. The CVT belt is slack in this image. We designed this feature on purpose to allow for a slip clutch where the belt isnâ€™t always in tension in the range of the CVT. This allows us to being the vehicle to a complete stop without violating the rules laid out for the competition.
